Our todo list app can have multiple users using it at the same time. However, changes made by one user are not seen by others unless they manually refresh the browser.

In the preview window below, we can see `user-a` and `user-b`. Try making changes to data as `user-a` and see how `user-b` needs to click `reload page` to see these changes.
